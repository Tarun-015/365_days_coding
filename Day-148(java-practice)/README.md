LinkedList, Stack & Queue

This section covers the linear data structures that are key components of the Java Collections Framework.

   Concepts Covered:

LinkedList — Doubly linked list, fast insert/delete.

Stack — LIFO operations (push, pop, peek).

Queue — FIFO structure using LinkedList.

PriorityQueue — Orders elements by natural priority.

   Key Takeaways:

LinkedList is better for frequent insertion/deletion.

Stack is ideal for recursive/undo operations.

Queue ensures first-come-first-serve processing.

PriorityQueue automatically sorts elements.
