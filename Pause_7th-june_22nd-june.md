# ⏸️ 365 Days of Code – TEMPORARY PAUSE NOTICE

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm currently taking a short **2-week break** from my 365 Days of Code journey to focus on some other ongoing commitments, including events and academic responsibilities.

## ⏱️ Pause Dates:
**Start:** 7th june'25  
**Resume:** 23rd june'25

This isn’t a stop—it’s just a pit stop. I’ll be back soon, sharper and more focused, to continue building, learning, and sharing regularly.

Thanks for the support so far!
Stay tuned 🚀
