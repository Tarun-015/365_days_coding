This section introduces the List interface and the ArrayList class â€” a dynamic array in Java that allows flexible storage and manipulation of elements.

   Concepts Covered:

Dynamic resizing (unlike fixed-size arrays)

Iterating using for, for-each, and Iterator

Using lambda expressions for filtering (removeIf)

Sorting and reversing collections using Collections utility

   Key Takeaways:

ArrayList is ordered, indexed, and allows duplicates.

Collections.sort() sorts data in ascending order.

Collections.reverse() reverses the current order.

removeIf() uses lambda expressions to simplify element removal.
