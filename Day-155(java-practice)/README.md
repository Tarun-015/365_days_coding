Callable and Future for return values

ScheduledExecutor for delayed or periodic tasks


Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| `ExecutorService` | Interface for managing thread pools |
| `execute()` | Submits Runnable tasks without result |
| `submit()` | Submits tasks that return a Future |
| `Callable<T>` | Similar to Runnable but returns a result |
| `Future<T>` | Represents the result of an asynchronous computation |
| `scheduleAtFixedRate()` | Runs tasks periodically after a delay |
