# Java Serialization Examples

This folder contains Java programs demonstrating **Serialization and Deserialization** concepts in Java.



##  What is Serialization?
Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a byte stream so it can be:
- Saved to a file
- Transferred over a network
- Stored in databases

Deserialization is the reverse process (byte stream â†’ object).
