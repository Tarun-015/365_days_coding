# 365 Days of Coding 🚀

Welcome to my journey of consistency, curiosity, and code. This repository is my personal log of the **365 Days of Coding** challenge — a commitment to show up every single day and become a better problem-solver, developer, and thinker.


## 🌟 What's This All About?

The idea is simple: **code every day for 365 days**. Whether it’s solving algorithmic problems, building mini-projects, exploring new technologies, or just revising old concepts — the goal is to build discipline and track my growth as a coder.


## 📌 What You'll Find Here

This repository will gradually fill up with:

- 💡 **Daily practice problems and solutions**
- 🛠️ **Mini-projects**
- 📚 **Notes and summaries of topics I've learned**
- 📊 **Progress tracking and reflections**
- 🚀 **Experiments with new tools, libraries, and languages**

Each day might look different — and that’s the beauty of it.



## 🧠 Tech Stack & Topics

I'm not restricting myself to any one language or domain. Here's what you might encounter over time:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C, Java, C++ and more
- **Concepts:** Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, File Handling, API usage
- **Tools & Tech:** GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter, maybe even some ML & Web Dev 👀
- **Platforms:** HackerRank,Leetcode,CodeChef,CodeForces,et.



## 🗂️ Repo Structure

The repo will be organized in a simple way:
and so on. Each folder represents a day’s work.
