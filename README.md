🚀 365 Days of Coding Challenge
Welcome to the 365 Days Coding Challenge! This is a long-term journey to code every single day for a year, aimed at building a strong foundation in problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, and real-world logic building.

📌 Purpose
This repository is meant to:

Boost coding consistency and discipline

Improve logical thinking and algorithmic skills

Track daily progress in an organized manner

Prepare for interviews and coding competitions


🗂 Structure
Each folder is labeled as:
Day-01/
Day-02/
...
Day-365/


Inside each day's folder:

README.md – Problem descriptions or daily notes

solution.py / main.cpp – Actual solution code

Additional files as needed for testing or documentation


📅 Progress
✅ Days Completed: X/365
🕒 Updates: every 15 days
📈 Consistency is the key – even 30 minutes/day adds up!


💡 How to Use
Browse by folders (Day-XX)

Read the problem statement in README.md

Open solution files (.py, .cpp, etc.)

Run and try improving or solving on your own!

🤝 Contributions
This is a personal learning challenge, but:

Suggestions and feedback are welcome!

You can fork and start your own 365-days-coding journey based on this template!
