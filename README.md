365 Days of Coding Challenge ::

Welcome to my 365 Days of Coding repository! This project is a personal initiative to code every day for a full year, aiming to improve my programming skills and explore new technologies, languages, and tools. By the end of the year, I hope to have gained valuable hands-on experience, developed projects, and tackled various coding challenges.

Goals ::

>Commit to coding daily for 365 days straight.
>Learn and improve in different programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and frameworks.
>Build projects and contribute to open-source.
>Develop problem-solving skills and strengthen my technical knowledge.

How it works ::

>Each day, I will make a commit showing the coding activities I have worked on.
>The activities will include, but are not limited to:
>Learning new concepts.
>Solving coding problems (from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.).
>Building and improving projects.
>Exploring new libraries, tools, and frameworks.
>Contributing to open-source projects.

Repository Structure ::

Day1/: The folder for Day 1 of the challenge with any code, notes, or explanations.
Day2/: Similarly, each subsequent folder will contain the code and documentation for that day's activities.


How to Follow Along ::

>You can follow my progress through the commits and check out the code I’ve worked on each day.
>Feel free to open issues, give feedback, or contribute if you want to collaborate on any of my projects.

Contributing ::

If you'd like to contribute, you can fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your changes or improvements.

Motivation ::

This project is part of my journey to becoming a better programmer and to constantly push myself to grow. Whether I’m learning a new algorithm, building a web app, or solving coding challenges, every day is a step forward in my coding journey.

<<Thank you for checking out my challenge, and I hope you find my progress useful and inspiring!>>
