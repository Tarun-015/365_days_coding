Polymorphism in Java

Polymorphism allows a single entity (method, operator, or object) to take multiple forms.
In Java, there are two main types:

 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Achieved by method overloading.

Same method name, but different number or type of parameters.

Decided by the compiler at compile time.

2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

Achieved by method overriding.

Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.

Decided at runtime by JVM (via dynamic method dispatch).
