## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. When the game starts, it randomly picks a secret number between 1 and 100.
2. You have 10 chances to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, youâ€™ll be told if your guess is too high or too low.
4. If you guess correctly within the limit, you win!
5. If not, the game ends and reveals the secret number.
