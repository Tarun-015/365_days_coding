This part focuses on mini case-study exercises that combine data manipulation (dplyr) and visualization (ggplot2), simulating real-world scenarios such as employee analysis, product sales, student performance, and monthly revenue trends.

   Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you will:

✔ Perform grouping, summarization, and conditional operations on data.

✔ Use mutate and filter to create and manipulate variables.

✔ Build bar charts and line charts to represent data visually.

✔ Apply R skills to simulate real-world mini dashboards combining dplyr + ggplot2.
