# Q47 â€“ Student Performance Dashboard Project

# Scenario: College wants to monitor student marks.
# Tasks:

# Create a dataset with Name, Dept, Marks, HoursStudied.

# Add Grade based on marks using case_when.

# Calculate average marks per department.

# Visualize:

# Grade distribution (bar chart)

# Marks vs Study Hours (scatter plot, color-coded by department)

# Average marks per department (bar chart)

# Concepts: mutate, group_by, summarize, ggplot2 (geom_bar, geom_point).
