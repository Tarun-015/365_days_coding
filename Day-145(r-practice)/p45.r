# Q45 â€“ Employee Department Analysis Project

# Scenario: HR wants insights about employee distribution and salaries.
# Tasks:

# Create a dataset with EmployeeID, Name, Dept, Salary, Gender.

# Calculate average salary per department.

# Find department-wise male/female counts.

# Visualize:

# Average salary per department (bar chart)

# Gender distribution per department (stacked bar chart)

# Concepts: dplyr (group_by, summarize), ggplot2 (geom_bar, position="stack").
