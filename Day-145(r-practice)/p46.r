# Q46 â€“ Product Revenue Dashboard Project

# Scenario: E-commerce team wants to analyze product performance.
# Tasks:

# Create a dataset with Product, Category, UnitsSold, Price.

# Add a Revenue column (UnitsSold * Price).

# Filter high revenue products (Revenue > threshold).

# Visualize:

# Revenue by product (bar chart)

# Revenue by category (stacked bar chart or grouped bar chart)

# Concepts: mutate, filter, group_by, summarize, ggplot2.

# Calculate Revenue

# Filter high revenue products (> 1,000,000)

# Visualize revenue by product
